## Stage 2: Problem Breakdown

Integrating LLM-generated tests into a CI/CD pipeline introduces several key challenges:

**Pipeline Integration:**

- Ensuring smooth communication between the CI/CD pipeline and the LLM-based test generation API.
- Managing the latency of test generation and its impact on overall pipeline performance.

**Scalability & Throughput:**

- Handling multiple concurrent test generation requests, especially during peak development times, to avoid bottlenecks in the CI/CD process.

**Security & Data Privacy:**

- Ensuring that sensitive code or data used to generate tests remains secure, especially if shared or private endpoints are involved.

**Customization & Test Relevance:**

- Ensuring that the generated tests are relevant, covering edge cases and aligned with the client’s codebase, frameworks, and business logic.

### Assumptions

- The client has a moderate to high volume of test generation requests.
- The client has specific security/compliance needs requiring private infrastructure.
- There is no Test Gen Agent database required, as the agent workflow should be stateless and can be easily rescheduled on a different pod. If test gen needs any dashboard/reporting/analytics, then a database of all the scheduled jobs and there results can be maintained by the CI/CD system.

### High Level Architecture - Generate tests on CI/CD pipeline

> Recommended solution would be **Enterprise solution (Simplismart is responsible for Test Generation Agent)**,
>
> Incase clients wants to maintain the Test Generation Agent, Private endpoint or shared endpoint can be used. Feedback loop (Logs, Errors, Performance) for continuous improvement needs to be aggreed upon by client and Simplismart.

![](./assets/testgen-architecture.png)

- On push the GitHub Action/Jenkins pipeline is triggered.
- Diff Analyser runs on the code diff
  - Check for new/modified files. if the file has lot of content consider running test generation on smaller chunks of file. i.e functions/classes.
  - Check for new/modified functions.
  - Filters out test files.
  - Filters out unsupported languages/frameworks.
- Test Generator runs on the filtered code diff
  - Generates tests for new/modified files/functions.
  - Saves generated tests to a file. (Inteligently choosing file names/paths based on language/framework)
  - Business rules aka System Instructions on test generation is injected into Test Generator.
- Test Executor runs on the generated tests
  - Executes the generated tests
  - Checks the results and reports any failures (Complilation errors, test failures)
- Code Coverage Analysis
  - Runs on the generated tests and checks if the threshold is met.
  - If not new test are generated for uncovered code.
- Generate a PR with test report for review
- Review Handler
  - Collects the review and sends to the test generator.
- Perform Post TestGen Steps
  - If the tests are approved, they are merged to the main branch.
  - If the tests are not approved, the PR is closed.
- Collect agent error and performance for quality assurance. which can be used for model improvement.
- Aggregate logs and push them to a centralized logging system or cloud logging.

#### NFR's

- Scalability:
  - Scaling of agents for test generation and execution. One Agent per pod.
  - Or the entire agent workflow can be containerized and scaled as a single unit. where the CI system would be responsible for triggering the workflow and the workflow would be self-contained.
- Security:
  - Data Encryption in transit and rest.
  - API Keys and Key Rotation.
- Secret Management for API keys and other sensitive information.
- Compliance as per client requirements.
- Performance:
  - Appropriate machine spec should be chosen based on the volume of tests and expected execution time.
  - Latency requirements should also be considered.
  - Leverage caching and asnyc test generation to improve performance.
  - Perform small incremenatal test execution if the language/framework supports it.
- High Availability & Disaster Recovery:
  - if agent is running on CICD pod, then the agent workflow should be stateless and can be easily rescheduled on a different pod.
  - if the agent is running as a containerized unit, then the agent workflow should be designed to be resilient and can be easily rescheduled on a different node.
  - There is no data stored on the CI/CD system.

### Understanding Deployment Choice

#### Shared Endpoint Integration

![](./assets/shared-endpoint.png)

**High-level Architecture:**

The CI/CD pipeline calls Simplismart’s shared LLM endpoints via API to generate integration tests for every commit or PR. The generated tests are then integrated into the pipeline and executed.

**Advantages:**

- Low setup complexity.
- Cost-effective.
- Quick implementation.

**Disadvantages:**

- Shared infrastructure may introduce latency and resource contention during peak hours.
- Less control over security, customization and compliance.
- Limited flexibility if test generation requires specific business logic.

**Required Resources and Dependencies:**

- API integration in the existing CI/CD pipeline.
- Simplismart’s shared API key and documentation.
- Basic monitoring to ensure API performance.

**Assumptions:**

- The client has moderate security needs and can tolerate shared infrastructure.
- Test generation time is within acceptable limits for their pipeline.

#### Private Endpoint Integration

![](./assets/private-endpoint.png)

**High-level Architecture:**

The client deploys Simplismart’s private LLM endpoint on their own infrastructure or a dedicated cloud instance.

**Advantages:**

- Improved security, with data isolated from shared infrastructure.
- Faster test generation, data locality and caching.
- Customization options for specific testing needs.

**Disadvantages:**

- Higher inital cost and commitment to shared infrastructure.

**Required Resources and Dependencies:**

- Private instance of Simplismart’s LLM endpoint.
- Compute resources to host the endpoint and caching layer.
- Additional monitoring for the endpoint’s health and performance.

**Assumptions:**

- The client has a moderate to high volume of test generation requests, making caching effective.
- The client has specific security/compliance needs requiring private infrastructure.

#### Enterprise Offering with Full Customization and CI/CD Integration

![](./assets/enterprise-offering.png)

**High-level Architecture:**

The client uses Simplismart’s enterprise offering, which provides full control over the LLM infrastructure, including on-premise deployment, custom API configurations, and end-to-end integration with the CI/CD pipeline.

**Advantages:**

- Full control over security, customization, and performance.
- Ability to deeply integrate test generation logic with the client’s unique business rules and testing framework.
